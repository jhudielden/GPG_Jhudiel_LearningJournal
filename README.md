Despite having an old repository for an old summer project and had no idea what I was using, I'm starting to understand what I'm looking actually at now. Going to have to learn the other MarkDowns to further optimise my use of GitHub. If I'm confused by it, I'll dread using it and not use it as efficient as possible. Also being a slight perfectionist, I do want the history and the layout to be consistent as much as possible. 
Interestingly enough, I have gotten used to documenting creative processes in multiple different programs, but the fact that I did it in different programs, I have gotten into different habits.
