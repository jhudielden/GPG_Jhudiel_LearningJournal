## 000 Preliminary Journal-Log 15/10/2024
Despite having an old repository for an old summer project and had no idea what I was using, I'm starting to understand what I'm looking actually at now. Going to have to learn the other MarkDowns to further optimise my use of GitHub. If I'm confused by it, I'll dread using it and not use it as efficient as possible. Also being a slight perfectionist, I do want the history and the layout to be consistent as much as possible. 
Interestingly enough, I have gotten used to documenting creative processes in multiple different programs, but the fact that I did it in different programs, I have gotten into different habits.

Today all I was able to complete was the start of the 1st tutorial, a 2D player movement for a top down view. I had no setbacks or problems with the code necessarilly just having to check how the `Input.GetAxis` works in Unity as I've only used it in a 3D tutorial not in the 2D space. I had to check if changing the code from `Vector3` to a `Vector2` still worked, though I think it doesn't matter since the project is stuck in the 2D space. 

The only setback I can see is not with code specifically but with the scope of what I want to code and make, I initially made a huge list of potential things I want to learn to code to then make it into a tutorial, and set myself up for Decision fatigue I'm assuming.

Today I've almost finished like 95% almost finished the first tutorial, with no problems with code thankfully, just writing it out and explaining is what's slowing me down. I know the code works but it's just how it works that I explained, though I don't think is necessary but I do now understand some declarations and their descriptions to know how some things are done.

I started on some new code, I wanted to make a sliding tile puzzle. Though a game with a very simple functionality, coding it is still complex. I found a tutorial and watched 3 episodes out of 5 before first before following along with it. The first thing was that the tutorial used imported sprites of tiles and numbers. Tiles I can just use the the 2D Sprites but the numbers seemed to complicated use `TextMeshPro` text, so I ended up importing some number png from Google Images. So the first problem I faced wasn't code itself but using Unity.

Following along with the tutorial videos I found were fine. The only small problem I faced was
